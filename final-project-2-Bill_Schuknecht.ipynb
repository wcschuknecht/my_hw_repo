    "Capital Bikeshare is a program in Washington, D.C. where customers obtain bikes via automated kiosks located throughout the city. Using this on-demand system, users can rent a bike from one location and return to a different location.\n",

    "A significant operational challenge for management is proper allocation of assets throughout the system, over time. In this analysis we will feed time series models a combination of historical usage data and weather data to forecast hourly rental demand for Capital Bikshare. Accurately predicting ridership will enable management to optimize allocation of employees and bikes throughout the system, ultimately providing better service to customers while saving time and money.\n",

    "As a resident of NYC over the past eight years I have observed recurring consumption behavior associated with the city's 'Citi Bike' bike sharing program. This includes high-level trends like relatively higher ridership during warm hours compared to cold hours, relatively higher ridership during hours with no precipitation compared to hours with precipitation, and relatively higher ridership during commuting hours compared to non-commuting hours. Although these observations are specific to my own experience and should not necessarily be generalized to the system overall, they have informed the hypothesis that temperature will have the greatest impact on hourly ridership count predictions.\n",

    "This problem and dataset originates from Kaggle, and as such has hundreds of proposed solutions. Stochastic gradient descent regression, random forest regressor (RF), and gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT) are three models consistently tested among many proposed solutions. On the basis of root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE), averaging RF and GBRT appear to yield top results among submissions."

    "I selected this project because of the tremendous wealth of previous work that can be referenced as a guide. This of course presents the challenge of somehow modifying the approach to \"make it my own\". To that end, my goal is to focus on feature engineering within the context of the various aforementioned models to produce unique results. \n",

Regarding success, my goal is to rank in the top half of Kaggle submissions. If I am unable to achieve this goal I will solicit advice from fellow data scientists on possible modeling or feature engineering alternatives. "
