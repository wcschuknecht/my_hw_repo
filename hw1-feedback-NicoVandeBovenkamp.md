### ***Project 1 Feedback***

***Nico Van de Bovenkamp***

**Overall:** Good work! Your answers are on point!

**Some notes**
* ***Part 1 - Q.4:*** Usually a hypothesis is a bit stronger. If [condition], then [claim]. The statement you have is a bit more like, 'these factors have a non-zero effect on conversion'
* ***Part 2 - Q.1:*** Make sure you define your X matrix as the set of all features (GRE, GPA, and Prestige).

***Note: if you ever feel a topic is too elementary, please ask for some suggestions for more advanced readings and I can send things your way (especially once we get into modeling!)***
